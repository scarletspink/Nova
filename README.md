It looks like you've uploaded a Jupyter notebook file related to linear regression. I can review it and provide a brief explanation of its content in six points. I'll start by examining the file.

Based on the contents of the notebook, here's a brief six-point summary of the linear regression exercise:

1. **Objective**: The task involves predicting restaurant profits based on city population data using linear regression with one variable.

2. **Problem Setup**: The dataset includes city populations (`x_train`) and corresponding restaurant profits (`y_train`). The goal is to predict potential profits for other cities based on population.

3. **Packages Used**: Key Python libraries such as `numpy` (for numerical computations) and `matplotlib` (for plotting) are used, along with helper functions from a separate `utils.py` file.

4. **Cost Function**: A cost function \( J(\theta) \) is computed to measure the error between predicted and actual values. This helps guide the optimization of parameters.

5. **Gradient Descent**: The algorithm used to minimize the cost function by iteratively adjusting the parameters based on the gradient of the cost.

6. **Batch Gradient Descent**: This method updates the parameters after looking at all the training examples in each iteration, making it suitable for learning the best-fit line for the data.

Let me know if you'd like a deeper dive into any specific section!
